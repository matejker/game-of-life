# Game of life
> That game of life is hard to play  
I'm gonna lose it anyway  
The losing card I'll someday lay  
So this is all I have to say  

>Suicide is painless  
It brings on many changes  
And I can take or leave it if I please  

~ M.A.S.H

Started to read [The Recursive Universe](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Recursive-Universe-Complexity-Scientific-Knowledge/dp/048649098X), 
once again got amazed by this Conway toy.

> millions of dollars in valuable computer time may have already been wasted by the game's growing horde of fanatics
